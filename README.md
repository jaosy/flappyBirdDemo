**Demo game to learn LibGDX and Android Studio for COMP-225, Software Development**

Created on 12th February 2020

Based on video tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzBVTPaUUDg&list=PLZm85UZQLd2TPXpUJfDEdWTSgszionbJy

## Pros of LibGDX
- Easy to set up project and get started
- Easy to use your own pictures and soundfiles - just place them in the `assets` folder
- Classes that handle animation, textures, collision detection etc. already available in the LibGDX framework
- Uses Java syntax that we are familiar with from COMP 127
- Object-oriented; the class design was not hard to understand
- The bugs I encountered were all related to array indexing and were not irresolvable

## Cons of LibGDX
- The animation and camera movement parts were very math-y!
- No live preview of what the game looks like, you have to build and run from the emulator after coding
- Can't do drag and drop to design the user interface visually - you have to hard code it
- Exporting the project to Android also takes some coding to set the app's orientation and the camera view
